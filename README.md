# Deep Portrait Drawing
## Introduction
Generating Realistic Human Faces from sketches with fewer drawing skills is still a challenging and unsolved problems

In this project we aim to generate a Novel Deep Learning Model for sketch-based image synthesis to be used by artists or naive people.

we have decided to automate the tedious work of free hand sketches, we have come up with Deep Portrait Drawing.

A novel approach to generate realistic human faces from mere free hand sketches
